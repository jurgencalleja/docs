title: Transaction Result Call
position_number: 12
type: post
description: The purpose of this document is to describe the TRANSACTION RESULT CALL API Operation to enable merchant developers to integrate their webpages with the IPG Gateway.  Refer to the IPG Gateway – 0 – Overview document for how this API Operation is used in the merchant processes.
#A Transaction Result Call is a secure, server-to-server transmission between the IPG Gateway and the merchant’s server.  When an API operation is completed (successfully or not), a Transaction Result Call is sent to inform the merchant about the result and the status of the transaction.
##The Transaction Result Call is sent to the URL that is provided in merchantNotificationUrl in the Session Token Request of the Authorise or Purchase API Operation (see IPG Gateway – 2 – AUTH-PURCHASE-VERIFY – Direct API or IPG Gateway – 2 – AUTH-PURCHASE-VERIFY – Hosted Payment Page document, as appropriate to the integration method).  Transaction Result Calls in response to subsequent Void, Capture or Refund API Operations will use this same merchantNotificationUrl value, that is saved against the original transaction in the IPG Gateway.
#If the merchantNotificationUrl is not provided in the original transaction, no Transaction Result Call is sent.
